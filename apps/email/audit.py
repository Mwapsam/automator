"""Audit logging for email provisioning operations.

Every create/update/delete operation that touches the mail provider is recorded
in an AuditLog row so operators can trace who did what, when, and whether the
operation succeeded. The record() helper is the single call site throughout
the services layer.

Best-effort: a DB write failure logs an error but never raises, so an audit
failure never blocks the operation being audited.
