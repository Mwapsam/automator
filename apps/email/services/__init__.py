"""Email services package.

Business logic that views and Celery tasks call — never the provider directly.

Provisioning services (DomainService, MailboxService, AliasService) orchestrate:
  - Plan limit enforcement
  - Provider calls
  - Django ORM sync
  - Audit log writes

Sending helpers (smtp_send, apply_tracking) are exported here for backwards
compatibility with existing tasks.py imports.
